# Ikarus Backend Documentation

The Ikarus Backend provides two APIs:

* [Public API for App](app/public.md)
* [Private API for Management](management/private.md)

The public API is used by the Ikarus app to:
* Get the information about available events
* Get and modify attendance data of staff in an event

The private API is used to manage events:
* Create, update and delete events
* Create, update and delete staff for an event

Additionally there is a simple web interface provided,
which offers simple forms to access the private and the public interface.
